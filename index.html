    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application uses a top navigation bar to anchor the user and allow quick jumps to key sections: Philosophy, The Plan, Protocols, and Lifestyle. The core of the app is the "The Plan" section, which features an interactive daily schedule. Users click a day (e.g., "Monday") to dynamically display that specific workout's details. This task-oriented design prevents information overload by showing only relevant information, making the dense workout plan easy to navigate and consume daily. This structure was chosen for its superior usability over a long, static document, empowering the user to actively engage with their daily routine. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: Report Info -> 6-Day Workout Plan -> Goal: Organize & Inform -> Viz/Presentation Method: Interactive daily tabs and structured content cards. -> Interaction: User clicks a day button, JS dynamically renders the corresponding workout details in a clean, table-like format using HTML/CSS. This avoids overwhelming the user. Philosophy and lifestyle info are presented in distinct, easily digestible cards. -> Justification: This interactive approach is more engaging and practical for a user following a daily routine than a static page. It transforms the report from a document to a functional tool. -> Library/Method: Vanilla JS for interaction, Tailwind CSS for styling. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->

            <p class="max-w-3xl mx-auto text-lg text-gray-600">
                This program is designed for balanced muscle growth, strength, and overall fitness. It leverages a high-frequency, scientifically-proven Upper/Lower split to maximize results while managing recovery.

                    <h4 class="font-bold text-xl mb-3 text-teal-700">Upper/Lower Split Rationale</h4>
                    <p class="text-gray-600">This routine utilizes an Upper/Lower split, hitting each muscle group three times per week. Research by scientists like Dr. Brad Schoenfeld shows that stimulating muscle protein synthesis (MPS) more frequently can lead to superior hypertrophy compared to traditional "body-part splits". Training a muscle group every 48-72 hours keeps it in a more consistent anabolic state, promoting better growth and recovery by not annihilating a single muscle group in one session.</p>

                    <h4 class="font-bold text-xl mb-3 text-teal-700">Progressive Overload</h4>
                    <p class="text-gray-600">This is the cornerstone of all progress. To continuously build muscle and strength, you must consistently challenge your body. Implement this by: <br>1. <strong>Increasing Weight:</strong> Once you can comfortably hit the top of your rep range for all sets, add a small amount of weight. <br>2. <strong>Increasing Reps:</strong> Aim to add one more rep to your sets each week until you reach the top of the prescribed rep range. <br>3. <strong>Improving Form:</strong> Enhancing your technique increases muscle activation and is a form of progression.</p>

                    <h4 class="font-bold text-xl mb-3 text-teal-700">Compound vs. Isolation</h4>
                    <p class="text-gray-600">Our program prioritizes multi-joint compound exercises (squats, presses, rows). These movements are highly efficient, recruiting maximum muscle mass and stimulating a greater hormonal response for growth and strength. Isolation exercises (like curls or extensions) are used strategically to target specific muscles and add volume, but they are supplementary to the core compound lifts.</p>
